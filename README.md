# Where's Waldo?
---
This project presents a React implementation of the classic "Where's Waldo" game, in which you are presented with a certain scene with lots of characters and your task is to find Waldo and his friends.

Currently, only one scene is implemented together with its functionality. The game should work on any screen size.
